# Railway Routes Extraction from OSM (Work in progress)

This script demonstrates that the spatial geometries of railway routes can be extracted from a train schedule dataset. If done for the whole of railway routes in India, the resulting dataset can be a useful open dataset on public transport. The script uses OSMnx library to extract railway route from OpenStreetMaps' roads data by taking a sample of CSV files comprising the station locations along the route as input. 

A sample output geometries of the train routes can be found in [/Output_RouteGeometries/](https://github.com/rajesvariparasa/railway-routes-extraction-from-OSM/tree/main/Output_RouteGeometries). It demonstrates that it can be possible to extract the spatial geometries of , a valuable public transport dataset
