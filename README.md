# Railway Routes Extraction from OSM (Work in progress)

This script uses OSMnx library to extract railway route from OpenStreetMaps' roads data by taking CSV files comrpising the station locations along the route as input. A sample output geometries of the train routes can be found in [/Output_RouteGeometries/](https://github.com/rajesvariparasa/railway-routes-extraction-from-OSM/tree/main/Output_RouteGeometries)
